# Project 2 Starter Code

This repository contains the starter code for Project 2!

For comprehensive documentation, see the Project 2 Spec (https://cs161.org/proj2/start_coding.html).

Write your implementation in `client/client.go`, and your tests in `client_test/client_test.go`.

To test your implementation, run `go test -v` inside of the `client_test` directory.

**Do not clone this repository! We are using GitHub classroom this semester. An invite link to your class-managed repository will be made available on Piazza.**
